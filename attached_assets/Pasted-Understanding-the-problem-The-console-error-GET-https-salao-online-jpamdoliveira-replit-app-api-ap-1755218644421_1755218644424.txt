Understanding the problem
The console error GET https://salao-online-jpamdoliveira.replit.app/api/appointments?page=1&limit=50&month=2025-08&status=scheduled 500 (Internal Server Error) indicates that the server encountered an unexpected condition while trying to fulfill the GET request for appointments. A 500 Internal Server Error is a generic server-side error, meaning something went wrong on the server that prevented it from responding successfully [1, 2].

The error is not a client-side issue with your code making the request, but rather a problem on the server handling the /api/appointments endpoint with the provided query parameters (page=1, limit=50, month=2025-08, status=scheduled).

How to verify
To verify that this is a server-side issue, you can try accessing the same URL (https://salao-online-jpamdoliveira.replit.app/api/appointments?page=1&limit=50&month=2025-08&status=scheduled) directly in your browser or using a tool like Postman. If you receive a 500 error in those cases as well, it confirms the problem lies with the server.

Additionally, check the server logs for the application running on salao-online-jpamdoliveira.replit.app. The logs should provide more specific details about the error that occurred on the server when it received this request.

Suggested fix
Since the error is on the server side, you need to investigate the backend code that handles the /api/appointments endpoint. Common causes for a 500 error include:

Unhandled exceptions: An error occurred during the processing of the request that was not caught.
Database issues: Problems connecting to or querying the database for appointment data.
Incorrect logic: Errors in the server-side code that processes the query parameters and fetches appointments.
Resource issues: The server might be running out of memory or other resources.
You will need to debug the server-side code to identify the specific cause of the unexpected condition. Look for the code that processes the GET request to /api/appointments and examine how it handles the page, limit, month, and status query parameters.
